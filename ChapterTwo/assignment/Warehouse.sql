-- Explain why you cannot use a subquery in your answer to Review Question 2.52.
-- You cannot use a subquery for review because the problem is not about filtering or selecting specific rows first, but about aggregation across the entire INVENTORY table grouped by categories.

-- Explain how subqueries and joins differ.
-- Subqueries and joins both combine data from tables, but they do it in very different ways and at different stages of query processing.

-- Write an SQL statement to join WAREHOUSE and INVENTORY and include all rows of WAREHOUSE in your answer, regardless of whether they have any INVENTORY. Include all columns of both tables, but do not repeat the join column.
-- SELECT w.*, i.* FROM WAREHOUSE w LEFT JOIN INVENTORY i ON w.WarehouseID = i.WarehouseID;
